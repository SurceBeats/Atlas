## About The Atlas

The Atlas is a procedural generation engine designed to create vast, complex galaxies and universes. Built with advanced algorithms and some astrophysical phenomena, The Atlas offers an unparalleled toolset for generating realistic and immersive cosmic environments. It has been widely inspired by the team behind No Man's Sky.

## Key Features

- **Procedural Galaxy Creation**: Generate diverse galaxies with unique star systems, planetary bodies, and cosmic events.
- **Universe Simulation**: Simulate the creation of an entire universe.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune every aspect of the generation process to create the exact type of universe or galaxy you need, including Physical Constants (pymodules/constants.py).

## How Big is "The Atlas"?

In "The Atlas," you can explore a universe of staggering proportions. Here's a glimpse of just how immense it is:

- **Number of Galaxies**: The universe can contain up to **1 trillion** (10^12) galaxies, each positioned within a vast space with coordinates ranging from 0 to 10 million in each direction.
- **Galaxy Types and Sizes**:
  - **Dwarf Galaxies**: These contain between **100,000 and 10 million** solar systems.
  - **Spiral Galaxies**: These typically have between **1 billion and 50 billion** solar systems.
  - **Elliptical Galaxies**: These massive galaxies can contain between **10 billion and 100 billion** solar systems.
- **Total Solar Systems**: With these ranges, the total number of solar systems across all galaxies in the universe can reach up to **10^23** (100 sextillion) solar systems.
- **Planets**: Each solar system can have between **1 and 6 planets**, leading to an estimated **quintillions** (10^18) of planets scattered across the universe.

These numbers highlight the incredible scale and richness of "The Atlas," where every exploration reveals new galaxies, stars, and worlds within a nearly infinite cosmos.

## How to run it?
- First, install Pillow to enable image generation at runtime and Flask as a webserver. You can do this by running pip install Pillow and pip install Flask, which should work on most systems. After that, run python3 pointing to the folder. Then, open your browser and navigate to the localhost URL. You're all set!
- Alternatively, you can run pip install -r requirements.txt to install both dependencies automatically!
