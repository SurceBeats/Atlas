## About The Atlas

**The Atlas** is a procedural generation engine designed to create vast, complex galaxies and universes. Built with advanced algorithms and inspired by real astrophysical phenomena, *The Atlas* offers an unparalleled toolset for generating realistic and immersive cosmic environments. It draws inspiration from the team behind *No Man's Sky* and pushes the boundaries of space simulation.

## Key Features

- **Procedural Galaxy Creation**: Generate diverse galaxies with unique star systems, planetary bodies, and cosmic events.
- **Universe Simulation**: Simulate the creation and evolution of entire universes, complete with expanding galaxies and planetary motion.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune every aspect of the generation process, from physical constants to universe seeds, ensuring a personalized experience (editable via `pymodules/__constants.py`).

### Configuration Made Simple

We've recently introduced the *Atlas Initialization Protocol*, a detailed onboarding process that guides you through configuring your universe on its first start. You can now choose between exploring the `Core Continuum` (the default shared universe) or creating your own unique universe via the `Design the Multiverse` option, which uses a seed-based initialization system.

**Stargate links** will only function properly within the `Core Continuum`. If you opt to create a custom universe using the `Design The Multiverse` feature, for stargates to work with others, both parties must have the same `cosmic_origin_time` and seed configured in their `atlas.ini` files. Without this, stargates won’t connect unless your Atlas server is publicly accessible on the internet.

Explore, experiment, and evolve with *The Atlas*—a universe where space and time converge in infinite possibilities.

## How Big is "The Atlas"?

In *The Atlas*, you can explore a universe of staggering proportions:

- **Galaxies**: Up to **1 sextillion** (10²¹) galaxies, each located within a vast 10-million-unit coordinate system.
- **Galaxy Types**:
  - **Dwarf Galaxies**: 100,000 to 10 million solar systems.
  - **Spiral Galaxies**: 1 billion to 50 billion solar systems.
  - **Elliptical Galaxies**: 10 billion to 100 billion solar systems.
- **Solar Systems**: Approximately **50 tredecillion** (5 × 10³¹) solar systems across all galaxies.
- **Planets**: Each solar system has 1 to 6 planets, resulting in an estimated **300 tredecillion** (3 × 10³²) planets.

These numbers showcase the incredible scale of *The Atlas*, where every exploration reveals new cosmic wonders within a nearly infinite cosmos.

## Storage Requirements for "The Atlas" Images

If all the images generated by *The Atlas* were stored (which isn't the case), the storage requirements would be astronomical:

- **Galaxies**: **1.92 zettabytes** for 1 sextillion galaxies.
- **Solar Systems**: **96 yottabytes** for 50 tredecillion solar systems.
- **Planets**: **576 yottabytes** for 300 tredecillion planets.

### Total Storage

In total, fully documenting *The Atlas* in images would require **672 yottabytes** (6.72 × 10²³ petabytes). However, thanks to our cache system, storage isn't an issue.

Even with the cache disabled, images are generated as BLOBs and sent in real-time during execution. While this is not recommended due to the increased server load, it remains an option. When the cache is disabled, no images are stored—everything is generated on-the-fly and discarded after being sent.

---

## Daemon Cache Thread

To optimize performance, we've implemented a **daemon cache thread** that renders and stores images temporarily in `static/cache` for 15 minutes before deleting them. This reduces server load and ensures that images are updated and regenerated with each view, reflecting dynamic changes such as galaxy expansion and planetary rotation.

You can disable the cache in the `atlas.ini` file by setting `enable_cache` to `False` and also adjust the default cache cleanup interval by modifying the `cache_cleanup_time` to suit your preferred time limit.

### Important News

Since Version 0.6, we've added **time** to the space, making it possible for you to finally travel through space-time—just as it sounds! The *cosmic_origin_time* marks the beginning, with `xyz4999999` as the center of the universe, which we named as the **Bit Bang**. As time passes, galaxies dynamically grow and evolve. According to our calculations, the estimated time for the universe to fully evolve from the *cosmic_origin_time* is **around 4.2 million years**. However, there are artifacts at the edges of the universe, as the growth factor, which is based on distance from the center, approaches zero.

New systems are continually added to galaxies, especially those near the center of the universe, which grow faster than outer systems. Additionally, we've introduced a **real-time simulation** of planetary orbits and rotations. Planets move in real-time based on their physical properties, with dynamic orbital paths and rotations.
